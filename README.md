1. Invoke a function getreg to find out the location L where the result of computation b op c should be stored.
2. Consult the address description for y to determine y'. If the value of y currently in memory and register both then prefer the register y' . If the value of y is not already in L then generate the instruction MOV y' , L to place a copy of y in L.
3. Generate the instruction OP z' , L where z' is used to show the current location of z. if z is in both then prefer a register to a memory location. Update the address descriptor of x to indicate that x is in location L. If x is in L then update its descriptor and remove x from all other descriptors.
4. If the current value of y or z have no next uses or not live on exit from the block or in register then alter the register descriptor to indicate that after execution of x : = y op z those register will no longer contain y or z.
